## Stress Structure & Engineering Dynamics 


## Unit Learning Outcome

1. Apply advanced engineering principles to analyse structural components.
2. Work to appropriate British or European Standards and Codes of Practice.
3. Carry out modal analysis and determine vibration response of multi-DOF systems.
4. Construct valid simulation models of mechanical problems using industry standard software.


## Assessments

### Stress and Structure: Exam Only, 50% of the units 
### Engineering Dynamics: Coursework Only, 50% of the units 


## Plan

- Each week: 4 Lectures, 4 workshops, 2 selfbooking labs, 1 drop-in.
- Resources: Moodle; Library Reading list; Matlab.
