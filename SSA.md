## SS_Topic 1:
### Beam Design (20 marks)
- Be able to design a section and select a standard profile to resist bending and transverse shear.
- Be able to apply the _perfect plasticity material model_ to analyse beam problems


## SS_Topic 2:
### Combined Stress (20 marks)
- Determine stresses developed in a structual member’s cross-section when the axial load, torsion, bending and shear occur simultaneously.


## SS_Topic 3:
### Thin-walled Sections (20 marks)
- Be able to calculate shear stress of thin-walled closed sections subjected to pure torsion
- Be able to determine twist angle of thin-walled closed sections


## SS_Topic 4:
### Energy Methods (40 marks) 
- Formulate the strain energy stored in a member, when it is subjected to an axial load, bending moment, transverse shear or torsional moment.
- Apply the principle of conservation of energy to determine the stress and deflection
- Apply the principle of virtual work to determine the displacement and slope at points on structural members and mechanical elements
- Apply the Castigliano’s theorem to determine the displacement and slope at points on structural members and mechanical elements.
